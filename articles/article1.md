Climate change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide. As temperatures rise and weather patterns shift, many species struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing conditions.

## Key Impacts

- Habitat loss and fragmentation
- Altered migration patterns
- Increased risk of extinction for vulnerable species
- Disruption of ecosystem services

To mitigate the impact of climate change on biodiversity, it is crucial to:

1. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions
2. Protect and restore critical habitats
3. Support conservation efforts and research
4. Promote sustainable land use practices

By taking action now, we can help preserve the incredible diversity of life on our planet for future generations.
